      In 2013 working in non-remunerated technology jobs, I see that`s my
      vocation is technology. In 2015, I decided to do a technic course to learn
      more about the theory. Day after day, I realized the course content was
      enough comparing with my self-taught study. Then, I decided to not do a
      graduation.
      <br />
      <br />
      Months later, a teacher invite me to teach some remunerated class for an
      EAD course of Java in a vocational school.
      <br />
      <br />
      When I finished high school and my technic course, I decided to work like
      a web developer. Then, all start to change in my career.
      <br />
      <br />
      After 7 months working with WordPress, I choose to focus my career in the
      front-end area, and, coincidentally, today I continue improving in this
      area. My subject is ever to provide the best user experience with my
      tools.
